### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

This vulnerability in the H2 database engine allows XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via the org.h2.jdbc.JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0
- Any other WSO2 products containing the H2 Database Engine from 1.4.198 and before 2.0.202

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

This vulnerability impacts the H2 database engine by exposing systems to XXE injection attacks. However, the specific method that could be exploited, org.h2.jdbc.JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML(), is not utilized within WSO2 products, including WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0.

The lack of reliance on this vulnerable method within our product effectively mitigates any associated risk. Additionally, the H2 database engine is not exposed externally in WSO2 product deployments, further reducing any potential impact of this vulnerability.

### CONCLUSION

Due to following key points,

- The vulnerable method is not used in our products.
- Upgrading to a H2 version that is not flagged for this vulnerability requires backward incompatible changes to the product. This requires users of WSO2 products to perform a data migration, when the vulnerability itself can never affect security of WSO2 products.

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is not an exploitable vulnerability in WSO2 products**, and **an H2 update will not be performed due to CVE-2021-23463**[^1].
